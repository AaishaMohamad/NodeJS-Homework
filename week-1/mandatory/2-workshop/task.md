# Workshop

## Complete

Finish the tasks from the workshop. These can be found [here](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/node/week-1/workshop.html).

## Improve

Try adding an `/about` route to your app to serve some HTML. How is this different from using express's static middleware? You can see one way of doing it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4529586/render-basic-html-view)
